# Groovies: Movies for Groups

Groovies is a social site which recommends new movies to groups of users based on their personal preferences. Users can upload their individual likes and dislikes, add new movies they've watched, and create groups with their friends. Once a group is created, user preferences are cross-referenced to generate a random suggestion of a movie you all might like.
